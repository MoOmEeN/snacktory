I have a love hate relationship with Twitter. As a user I see the benefits of Twitter, when looking at it without the spam, duplicates and senseless tweets e.g. through jetwick. But as a developer the Twitter API is very ‘heuristic’ and handwaving in a lot areas and makes it complicated to use. I would have been lost without the nice twitter4j project, so thanks to the author! Now let me give you some examples of Of course Twitter has API terms. This is necessary and nice to prevent the users from spam sites etc. But there is also a display style guideline, which I had ‘fun’ the last weekend. Where I was asked e.g. to make the hashtag links of jetwick according to the display guideline. This is annoying. Now I need to pop up a dialog instead of directly triggering a search on jetwick – hey, it is a search engine! But twitter has to make money. That is ok. But I would like to have an exception for free or open source projects. No chance … here is my email conversation regarding the minor API term violation: The answer from twitter is crystal clear that Twitter does not provide API term exceptions to open source projects like other companies does. It also indicates that the API guys have a bit too much to do as the support does not really answer my question and neither understands what github is nor what jetwick means: you’ll otherwise miss is that you are not allowed to offer an API to other people. Even if your project is open source! Here the email: “Returning Twitter data, like tweets, through an API of your own is not allowed, neither for commercial services nor independent or open-source services. We are not looking for partners to formally extend new APIs as you request.“ So, keep this all in mind when you start to build a system using or even relying on the Twitter API. I hope this post clarifies the mystics of the Twitter API a bit! If you have encountered similar issues: feel free to comment !
