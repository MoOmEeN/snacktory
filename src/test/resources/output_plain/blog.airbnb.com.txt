Hackers unite in Stanford's Dinkelspiel Auditorium for Y Combinator's Startup School. Here developers come together to share ideas and experiences and foster collaborations with some of the brightest minds in the startup world. The amount of sheer brainpower and code potential in one auditorium will be astounding. And when the inspiration and energy swells and the day closes, many go back to their respective cities galvanized and amped. What better way to celebrate this ideafest than with a party?! That's right, Airbnb's going to show y'all what it's like to party like a Y-Combinator. So mark your calendars for October 16th, and come on down to Project One in San Francisco! For all attendees of the conference, we'll have beats and bevvies a-plenty. RSVP here.
