Just because you star in a video game, doesn't mean you'll be any good at it. That's the hard lesson Pierce Brosnan learned during his appearance on The Tonight Show Tuesday – the former Bond, James Bond, was handily defeated by Jimmy Fallon at the classic Nintendo 64 game based on the first film Brosnan appeared in as the iconic British agent. A generation of kids grew up playing "GoldenEye 007" on the N64 platform – it's considered one of the most important titles in the first-person shooter genre and is a spiritual successor to millions-selling games like Microsoft's "Halo" franchise. But Brosnan apparently had little time to familiarize himself with the game during his tenure as 007 – he's handily defeated by Fallon, who admits to a long-held desire to play the game with the man who inspired it. (At least they hug and make up at the end.)

Meanwhile, Brosnan is back to his old spy tricks in The November Man, in which he plays an ex-CIA operative. The film hits theaters Aug. 27. Watch the full clip from his appearance below.
